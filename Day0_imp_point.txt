Lecture 0 : Diving into JavaScript.

Javascript is interpreted language.

* Each browser has its own javascript engine, which is either interpret the code, or uses some sort of lazy compilation
  * V8: chrome and Node.js
  * spiderMonkey: Firefox
  * JavascriptCore: Safari
  * chakra: Microsoft Edge/interpret

They each implement the ECMAScript standard, but may differ for anything not defined by the standard.  

ECMO stands for the Europen computer Manufacture Association and they're in charge 
of writting a standard for the language .

* Types
 * Dynamic typing 

 * Premitive types (no methods)

    * undefined 
    * null
    * boolean
    * number
    * string
    * (symbol)
* Objects    

Typecasting? Corercion 
* Explicit vs. Implicit Coercion

 * var x = 42;
 var explicit = string(x);  // explicit === "42"
 var implicit = x + "";    // implicit === "42"

 == Vs. ===

 * == coerces the types
 * === requires equilent types
