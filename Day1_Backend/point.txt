Backend Lecture No 3 Intro to Node and Express.

Exporting from Node Script.
* Used module.exports and exports.

importing into Node Script.
* require() 
  => if passed a path, it will run the script.
  => if passed a string, it will look in node_modules.


  Node Modules:

  Similar to liberaries in C or Python.
  More than 350,000 modules in the NPM registry

  NPM( Node package Manager like liberaries in C)

  * Node package Manager.
  * Automate installing, upgrading, removing moduels.
  * INstall package with npm install [-g] <package_name> if you want to install this gloabally.
  * Manage your own configuaration file withing `package.json`.

  Package.json

  * Defines configuaration for your application.
  * Full documenatition at (https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json)
  * Some tags define metadata: name, version, author.
  * Define scripts in "scripts" object
  * Track dependencies and devDependencies.

  NPM Commonds

  * 'npm install' installs all dependencies.
  * 'npm install --save <package>' installs package and adds to package.json
  * 'npm run <script_name>' runs <script_name> from the scripts object.

  Express.
  * Minimalist web application framework.
  * very lightweights very fast and it's very similar to flask and python.
  * very powerful routing system
  * hello_Express.js.

  * HTTP method so what are some HTTP methods we have, get, post,put, delete  .

  callback function: sending up an event listener so it's listening for something if it gets invoked that path
  under cetian method and if it does it'll invoke its callback and so method is an all lowercase HTTP method.

  * if you want to not upload the nodemodule into github repo then make a file by the name of .gitignore and 
  write code (node_modules/) 

  **************** copieng one file into another file(new file).***************
  cp hello_express.j app.js  // they create new file app.js and paste the content of hello_express.js
